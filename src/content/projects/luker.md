## About this project

A project developed in association with the GeneralSoft backend team. This web application was built using NextJS as frontend and .net as backend.

I worked as the lead developer of a team of three people and coordinated the application's frontend development. The greatest difficulty was to develop everything in a timeframe of six weeks. However, this period was met, and everything was delivered accordingly and deployed to a Windows server.
