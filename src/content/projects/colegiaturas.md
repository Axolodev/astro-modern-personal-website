## Acerca del proyecto.

Project developed in association with the IntelySoft backend team. This web application was built using NextJS as frontend and .net as backend, along with GraphQL as a means of communicating both parts.

In this project I took the role of lead frontend developer. The greatest difficulty I faced was connecting both the frontend and backend with the payment gateway. This project is currently up and running on a Windows Server.
