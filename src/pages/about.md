# Hello, I'm Rob! 

I'm a Software Engineer who does Front-end web development. Currently, I'm doing a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction.

Oh, and I'm also a teacher! 

I love learning new stuff. I'm passionate about making technology easier and more accessible for everyone to use.

I do a lot of React. I've been using it since 2018. I've created e-commerce and marketing sites, enterprise platforms, company websites, and more. Would you like to check out my work? You can find more about it on the [Portfolio section](./assets), see my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Axolodev?tab=repositories) or get in touch with me through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robruizr) if you are interested in something in particular.

I speak both Spanish and English, and I'm currently learning German. 

In my free time, I play videogames, read novels and nonfics, and practice bouldering. Sometimes I even sing!
